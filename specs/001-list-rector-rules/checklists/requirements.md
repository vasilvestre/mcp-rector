# Specification Quality Checklist: List Available Rector Rules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Content Quality
- ✅ Specification focuses on what users need (list, filter, search rules) without mentioning specific technologies
- ✅ User value is clear: helps PHP developers discover and select Rector rules for their projects
- ✅ Written in business-friendly language with clear user scenarios
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ All requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking if rules are retrieved)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (3 seconds, 1 minute, 90%, 80% precision)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on user-facing outcomes like retrieval time, not database queries)
- ✅ Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover key scenarios: version updates, missing metadata, large datasets
- ✅ Scope is clear: listing, filtering, and searching Rector rules
- ✅ Dependencies implicit: requires access to Rector's official rule sets

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ Each functional requirement links to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover core functionality (P1), filtering (P2), and search (P3)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- ✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. All quality criteria have been met.
